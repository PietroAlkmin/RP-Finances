During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments?

The answer is labor productivity that grew a strong 2.2% in 3Q. When workers are producing more, they can be paid more without stoking inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell actually addressed the issue in his press conference after the last FOMC meeting. He said that wages are 'still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.' But he added that 'if you take into account the high productivity readings we've had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2% inflation.' The next quarterly report on labor productivity is due on February 6. The 20-year average is about 1.7%.'  The new earnings season kicks off in mid-January, with the big banks reporting first. For 2025, Argus forecasts 12% EPS growth for S&P 500 companies. This follows a higher-than-expected 9% for 2024. There are a few companies on the earnings calendar this week, including Jefferies Financial Group and Albertsons on Wednesday; and Delta Air Lines, Constellation Brands, and Walgreens Boots Alliance on Friday. Also on the corporate front, the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, is this week in Las Vegas, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slated to speak. Last week, mortgage rates inched closer to 7% and climbed another 6 basis points (bps), with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.91%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices dropped two cents, with the average price of regular gas now at $3.00 per gallon. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 4Q and calls for expansion of 2.4%. The Cleveland Fed CPINow indicator is forecasting for December and is at 2.86%. Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve meets again at the end of January, with a rate decision on January 29.

Yet it's not a full trading week as markets will be closed on Thursday, which is a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped 0.5%.

For January, the consensus is 150,000. Our forecast is 125,000. The Unemployment Rate was 4.2% in December, and is not expected to change.

Last month, in its second estimate, the government indicated that 2Q GDP rose at an annualized 2.1% pace, up slightly from the 2.0% growth rate in 1Q23. We think that rate will hold steady, though we note that any surprise is likely to occur on the upside. As is typically the case, the report will indicate areas of strength and weakness in the economy.  On the positive side, the consumer appears to be in good shape, with Personal Consumption Expenditures expanding at a 1%-2% pace, driven by spending on Services. Companies continue to invest in R&D projects and software, as Investments into Intellectual Property are advancing at a rate that is faster than overall GDP growth. Government spending has picked up as well during the past year. On the downside, Residential Investment has weakened as interest rates have risen, though the sector seems to be bottoming; and Exports of Goods have been challenged by the strong dollar. The GDP report also includes an inflation measure, the PCE Price Index. This index, excluding food and energy, is rising at a 3.7% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%.

There were just too many signs of core strength in the results, including a 5.9% increase in Personal Consumption Expenditures on Durable Goods, a 3.0% increase in PCE Services, a 14% increase in Investment in Equipment, and an 11% increase in Investment in Intellectual Property Products. To be sure, high gas prices are weighing on the economy (PCE Nondurable Goods declined 3.7%) as is the war in Ukraine (Exports declined 5%). Quirks remain, as Government spending declined 3% and Imports rose 19%. Neither of those latter trends seems sustainable, in our view. And looking ahead, we anticipate a modest rebound in overall GDP in 2022.

The current low level of interest rates and the relatively high level of the dollar both attest to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy."}], "sigDevs": [{"headline": "Apple Says Lossless Audio And Ultra\u2011Low Latency Audio Come To Airpods Max - Website", "date": "2025-03-24"}], "secReports": [{"id": "0001140361-25-005876_320193", "type": "Corporate Changes & Voting Matters", "title": "8-K : Corporate Changes & Voting Matters", "description": "Current report filing", "filingDate": 1740441600000, "snapshotUrl": "https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-reports-thumbnails/0000320193/000114036125005876/thumbnail.png", "formType": "8-K"}, {"id": "0000320193-25-000008_320193", "type": "Periodic Financial Reports", "title": "10-Q : Periodic Financial Reports", "description": "Quarterly report pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)", "filingDate": 1738281600000, "snapshotUrl": "https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-reports-thumbnails/0000320193/000032019325000008/thumbnail.png", "formType": "10-Q"}, {"id": "0000320193-25-000007_320193", "type": "Corporate Changes & Voting Matters", "title": "8-K : Corporate Changes & Voting Matters", "description": "Current report filing", "filingDate": 1738195200000, "snapshotUrl": "https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-reports-thumbnails/0000320193/000032019325000007/thumbnail.png", "formType": "8-K"}, {"id": "0001308179-25-000008_320193", "type": "Proxy Statements", "title": "DEF 14A : Proxy Statements", "description": "Definitive proxy statements", "filingDate": 1736467200000, "snapshotUrl": "https://cdn.yahoofinance.com/prod/sec-reports-thumbnails/0000320193/000130817925000008/thumbnail.png", "formType": "DEF 14A"}, {"id": "0001308179-25-000009_320193", "type": "Proxy Statements", "title": "DEFA14A : Proxy Statements", "description": "Definitive additional proxy soliciting materials including Rule 14(a)(12) material.

During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI.

They can be used for support and resistance, overbought and oversold areas, the initiation of a strong uptrend with a break over the upper channel, and vice versa.  From October 2023, the SPX fell below its lower channel but rebounded quickly to the top channel. Price stayed between the mid- and upper channel until April 2024 -- when it fell back to the lower channel. SPX rebounded back to the top channel and then broke the midline in July.

The SPX is up 3.6% from its intraday low last Friday, the Nasdaq has popped 4.5%, and the QQQ is up 4.2%. The SPX has retaken its 50-day average quickly, and the five-day/13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossover is close to turning bullish. The five-/13-day EMA is already back to bullish on the Nasdaq and the QQQ. All three indices have retraced over 61.8% of their recent setbacks and are not far from making all-time highs.  Indicators we rarely talk about, and which are similar to Bollinger Bands, are price channels. For the daily chart, we use 20-day price channels. The upper channel is equal to the 20-day high, and the lower channel is equal to the 20-day low. The middle channel is the midpoint of the other two channels. There are many ways to interpret price channels. They can be used for support and resistance, overbought and oversold areas, the initiation of a strong uptrend with a break over the upper channel, and vice versa.  From October 2023, the SPX fell below its lower channel but rebounded quickly to the top channel. Price stayed between the mid- and upper channel until April 2024 -- when it fell back to the lower channel. SPX rebounded back to the top channel and then broke the midline in July. Since early August, prices have ripped back to the upper channel and found support from the mid- to lower channel. The index tested its bottom channel on Friday and popped once again.

The strong start to the month sent the S&P 500 and the other major indices to all-time highs. Even following the late-month selloff, stocks entered the final partial trading week of July barely changed for the month.  The stasis in the market is consistent with ongoing uncertainty. The nature of the presidential election changed dramatically over the past month. The Fed appears to be teeing up 50 basis points (bps) or possibly even 75 bps of rate cuts by the end of the year. However, no cuts appear likely until mid-September, leaving investors dangling. Consumers too are waiting for rate cuts, whether they know it or not, because a lower fed funds rate is the linchpin to getting the overall interest rate environment down from its multi-year peak. Amid the uncertainty, the second-quarter earnings season mostly has been a bright spot. While good past-quarter earnings are always important, investors hold their breaths regarding current-quarter outlooks. Companies have generally reaffirmed the moderately positive outlook for the full year, which is still trending toward high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth for 2024.  Up and Down in July The S&P 500, which came into mid-year up 14.5% for 2024, piled on an additional 3.8% in the first half of July. The index was up 18.8% for the year at its all-time closing peak of 5,667 on 7/16/24. By 7/19/24, the S&P 500 had shed over 100 points. And by 7/25/24, the index had lost more than 260 points from its all-time high, to close at 5,399. Given the strong start to the month, followed by equally strong selling, the S&P 500 entered the final partial trading week of July up 14.4% for the year - barely budged from where it stood at mid-year. The Trump assassination attempt and the switch in Democratic presidential contenders occurred in the space of two weekends. However, rather than point to political upheaval, most investors attributed the July selling to a much-needed correction in extremely overbought names in the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors. While some wealth flowed out of all equities in the late-July period, much of the proceeds from tech stock redemptions flowed into other sectors.  With three trading days remaining in the month as of 7/26/24, Information Technology (IYW) was down 4% for the month of July; and Communication Services (XLC) was down just under 2%. Where did the money go? Lots flowed into the Financial sector (IYF), which was up 7% for the month. Upcoming cuts in the fed funds rate will pinch banks' net interest margins. However, the 2Q earnings season for the sector has been highly positive, featuring significant recovery in fee-based businesses such as investment banking. Those upcoming lower interest rates can also be expected to rekindle loan and mortgage growth, which have been an ongoing negative amid generally positive bank earnings results. Other winning sectors in July include Industrials (IYJ), up 4.5%; Utilities (IDU), up 3.3%; Healthcare, up 2.9%; Consumer Staples, up 2.5%; and Materials, up 2.4%. Most of these sectors rose with the market early in the month and then were able to hold onto their gains on generally positive second-quarter earnings results. As we prepared this report, the market on 7/29/24 was oscillating, rising in the morning on earnings optimism toward traditional growth leaders and then selling off by midday on fears those companies would disappoint. The market response to upcoming earnings and other major non-technology companies could determine not just the July outcome, but also the market's performance in August and into summer-end. Second-Quarter Earnings Season The above-cited July 29-through-August 2 period will be the biggest week in 2Q24 EPS season, with about one-third of S&P 500 components companies reporting results. We will be sure to weigh in on the biggest earnings week, which culminates with equally big economic news, the nonfarm payrolls for July on 8/2/24. In the interim, and based on 2Q24 EPS data through 7/26/24, the second-quarter earnings season has been a success so far. With just over 180 companies (36%) of S&P 500 component companies reporting, second-quarter 2024 earnings from continuing operations are up 9.1% on a share-weighted basis compared with 2Q23 EPS. According to Bloomberg, 2Q24 earnings are up 14.8% on a market-cap-weighted basis. This premium of market-cap-weighted to share-weighted EPS growth is consistent with recent quarters and is reflective of the earnings outperformance of the largest capitalization companies compared with small and mid-caps. According to the other earnings compiling agencies, FactSet reports 9.8% earnings growth for 2Q24 as of 7/26/24; and Refinitiv is reporting 12% earnings growth. Variation in performance measurements among FactSet, Refinitiv and Bloomberg reflect minor differences in calculating continuing operations earnings as well as different prior-year baselines. For the remainder of our 2Q earnings report card, we will mainly source Bloomberg data unless otherwise noted. An unusually high percentage of companies (31%) have reported negative earnings for 2Q24. The average EPS decline for the negative-earnings group, which is heavily weighted in Energy, Materials, and Real Estate, is 16%. For the 69% of companies reporting positive EPS, average earnings growth is a robust 22%. A key reason investors are optimistic about second-half 2024 earnings growth is that the negative drag from Energy, Materials, and Real Estate is expected to diminish in 3Q24 and particularly in 4Q24. About 79% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises in 2Q24, compared with (again) a high 14% of companies reporting negative surprises. According to FactSet, 78% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises. These percentage are above the 10-year average of 74%. For these companies, the median beat against consensus estimates is 5.2% (FactSet has it at 4.4%). For the first time in several quarters, the median beat against expectations is below the 10-year average of 6.8%. At the sector level, the strongest earnings growth is coming from Financial, Information Technology, and Utilities - all up in the 16%-17% range year over year. Communication Services 2Q24 earnings are up 15%. Other sectors reporting positive EPS growth include Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and Industrials, in descending order; all are up in the 2%-4% range. As noted, Energy, Materials, and Real Estate are all down; Materials is off in high single-digits, while Energy and Real Estate earnings are down 20%-21% from a year earlier.  From a statistical standpoint, 36% would be considered a fairly reliable and predictive sample size. Timing of the remainder of 2Q24 earnings season, however, may introduce some variability. Over 61% of Financial companies have already reported, in what has been a better-than-anticipated season for the sector. Only 23% of Energy companies have reported; given similar sensitivity off all component companies to key commodities (oil and natural gas), the contribution from this sector will likely continue to pull down overall results. The swing sector is likely to be Information Technology. Fewer than 30% of tech companies have reported. Further, 2Q earnings from the heavy hitters (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) are not reflected in the data discussed above. Earnings from the big Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Discretionary (AMZN) companies could also play an outsized role. For 2Q24, Argus continues to model high-single-digit continuing-operations EPS growth for S&P 500 component companies. We see a higher likelihood that our forecast misses on the upside than on the downside. In other words, once all the component companies are tallied, we are more likely to see low-double-digit EPS growth for 2Q24 than we are to see mid-single-digit EPS growth.   Conclusion Investors will veer away from earnings analysis for a few hours on the morning of 8/2/24 to assess the state of the labor economy. Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, forecasts 185,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs for July, approximately in line with the 188,000 consensus forecast. The bigger focus will be on the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in June. If July unemployment hits 4.2%, that would trigger the Sahm indicator. When unemployment rises 50 bps within a cycle, the Sahm rule posits, recession follows or has already begun. In this scenario, deteriorating labor markets become 'a self-reinforcing feedback loop,' according to former New York Fed president William Dudley.  Secular and demographic factors may argue for structurally lower unemployment rates over the long term. This includes ongoing retirements from within the huge Baby Boomer cohort, and a smaller pool of workers from the generational cohorts that follow available to fill vacant boomer positions. Triggering the Sahm rule, nonetheless, would be a warning sign and presumably a wake-up call for the Fed to focus on the fight in front of it (preventing recession) and not the nearly won war against inflation.", "tickers": ["NDAQ", "DHI", "DLR", "SWKS", "BP", "PFE", "MSFT", "SYY", "KKR", "MA", "AMD", "EPD", "INCY", "QRVO", "AJG"], "title": "Summer Shakeout amid Positive EPS Season The stock market in mid- to late-July experienced its worst stretch of the year, including its worst week since 2022. The strong start to the month sent the S&P 500 and the other major indices to all-time highs. Even following the late-month selloff, stocks entered the final partial trading week of July barely changed for the month.  The stasis in the market is consistent with ongoing uncertainty. The nature of the presidential election changed dramatically over the past month. The Fed appears to be teeing up 50 basis points (bps) or possibly even 75 bps of rate cuts by the end of the year. However, no cuts appear likely until mid-September, leaving investors dangling. Consumers too are waiting for rate cuts, whether they know it or not, because a lower fed funds rate is the linchpin to getting the overall interest rate environment down from its multi-year peak. Amid the uncertainty, the second-quarter earnings season mostly has been a bright spot. While good past-quarter earnings are always important, investors hold their breaths regarding current-quarter outlooks. Companies have generally reaffirmed the moderately positive outlook for the full year, which is still trending toward high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth for 2024.  Up and Down in July The S&P 500, which came into mid-year up 14.5% for 2024, piled on an additional 3.8% in the first half of July. The index was up 18.8% for the year at its all-time closing peak of 5,667 on 7/16/24. By 7/19/24, the S&P 500 had shed over 100 points. And by 7/25/24, the index had lost more than 260 points from its all-time high, to close at 5,399. Given the strong start to the month, followed by equally strong selling, the S&P 500 entered the final partial trading week of July up 14.4% for the year - barely budged from where it stood at mid-year. The Trump assassination attempt and the switch in Democratic presidential contenders occurred in the space of two weekends. However, rather than point to political upheaval, most investors attributed the July selling to a much-needed correction in extremely overbought names in the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors. While some wealth flowed out of all equities in the late-July period, much of the proceeds from tech stock redemptions flowed into other sectors.  With three trading days remaining in the month as of 7/26/24, Information Technology (IYW) was down 4% for the month of July; and Communication Services (XLC) was down just under 2%. Where did the money go? Lots flowed into the Financial sector (IYF), which was up 7% for the month. Upcoming cuts in the fed funds rate will pinch banks' net interest margins. However, the 2Q earnings season for the sector has been highly positive, featuring significant recovery in fee-based businesses such as investment banking. Those upcoming lower interest rates can also be expected to rekindle loan and mortgage growth, which have been an ongoing negative amid generally positive bank earnings results. Other winning sectors in July include Industrials (IYJ), up 4.5%; Utilities (IDU), up 3.3%; Healthcare, up 2.9%; Consumer Staples, up 2.5%; and Materials, up 2.4%. Most of these sectors rose with the market early in the month and then were able to hold onto their gains on generally positive second-quarter earnings results. As we prepared this report, the market on 7/29/24 was oscillating, rising in the morning on earnings optimism toward traditional growth leaders and then selling off by midday on fears those companies would disappoint. The market response to upcoming earnings and other major non-technology companies could determine not just the July outcome, but also the market's performance in August and into summer-end. Second-Quarter Earnings Season The above-cited July 29-through-August 2 period will be the biggest week in 2Q24 EPS season, with about one-third of S&P 500 components companies reporting results. We will be sure to weigh in on the biggest earnings week, which culminates with equally big economic news, the nonfarm payrolls for July on 8/2/24. In the interim, and based on 2Q24 EPS data through 7/26/24, the second-quarter earnings season has been a success so far. With just over 180 companies (36%) of S&P 500 component companies reporting, second-quarter 2024 earnings from continuing operations are up 9.1% on a share-weighted basis compared with 2Q23 EPS. According to Bloomberg, 2Q24 earnings are up 14.8% on a market-cap-weighted basis. This premium of market-cap-weighted to share-weighted EPS growth is consistent with recent quarters and is reflective of the earnings outperformance of the largest capitalization companies compared with small and mid-caps. According to the other earnings compiling agencies, FactSet reports 9.8% earnings growth for 2Q24 as of 7/26/24; and Refinitiv is reporting 12% earnings growth. Variation in performance measurements among FactSet, Refinitiv and Bloomberg reflect minor differences in calculating continuing operations earnings as well as different prior-year baselines. For the remainder of our 2Q earnings report card, we will mainly source Bloomberg data unless otherwise noted. An unusually high percentage of companies (31%) have reported negative earnings for 2Q24. The average EPS decline for the negative-earnings group, which is heavily weighted in Energy, Materials, and Real Estate, is 16%. For the 69% of companies reporting positive EPS, average earnings growth is a robust 22%. A key reason investors are optimistic about second-half 2024 earnings growth is that the negative drag from Energy, Materials, and Real Estate is expected to diminish in 3Q24 and particularly in 4Q24. About 79% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises in 2Q24, compared with (again) a high 14% of companies reporting negative surprises. According to FactSet, 78% of companies have reported positive EPS surprises. These percentage are above the 10-year average of 74%. For these companies, the median beat against consensus estimates is 5.2% (FactSet has it at 4.4%). For the first time in several quarters, the median beat against expectations is below the 10-year average of 6.8%. At the sector level, the strongest earnings growth is coming from Financial, Information Technology, and Utilities - all up in the 16%-17% range year over year. Communication Services 2Q24 earnings are up 15%. Other sectors reporting positive EPS growth include Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, and Industrials, in descending order; all are up in the 2%-4% range. As noted, Energy, Materials, and Real Estate are all down; Materials is off in high single-digits, while Energy and Real Estate earnings are down 20%-21% from a year earlier.  From a statistical standpoint, 36% would be considered a fairly reliable and predictive sample size. Timing of the remainder of 2Q24 earnings season, however, may introduce some variability. Over 61% of Financial companies have already reported, in what has been a better-than-anticipated season for the sector. Only 23% of Energy companies have reported; given similar sensitivity off all component companies to key commodities (oil and natural gas), the contribution from this sector will likely continue to pull down overall results. The swing sector is likely to be Information Technology. Fewer than 30% of tech companies have reported. Further, 2Q earnings from the heavy hitters (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) are not reflected in the data discussed above. Earnings from the big Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Discretionary (AMZN) companies could also play an outsized role. For 2Q24, Argus continues to model high-single-digit continuing-operations EPS growth for S&P 500 component companies. We see a higher likelihood that our forecast misses on the upside than on the downside. In other words, once all the component companies are tallied, we are more likely to see low-double-digit EPS growth for 2Q24 than we are to see mid-single-digit EPS growth.

The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. But performance of these initial strategies lagged. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across industries that have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. At Argus Research, we track ESG progress at specific companies as part of our Management analysis -- one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point System for fundamental research. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have a \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records of delivering on the bottom line, and also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees.

During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division.

Two-thirds of the world will have internet access by 2023, while the number of connected devices is expected to grow to three-times the global population. IoT (machine to machine or M2M) connections are expected to grow at a 30% CAGR. Security is a top need, as \"denial of service\" attacks are set to double by 2023. To handle the challenges of managing, storing, and securing data amid this explosive traffic growth, data centers will need to harness the power of artificial intelligence. AI enhances data center capabilities though the power of machine learning, inference, and deep learning, all in an application-accelerated environment. The AI data center also makes use of non-traditional and emerging technologies that provide more computing power than traditional CPU-based architectures. These include GPU Compute from NVidia and Tensor cores from Google/Alphabet. As of mid-year 2021, about 600 hyperscale data centers were in operation around the world, up from about 500 at year-end 2019 and double the number from five years ago. The bulk of data center construction is by hyperscale providers including AWS from Amazon.com, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud from Alphabet, as well as with Chinese companies including Baidu and Alibaba. Co-location companies are another major data center driver, including Equinix and Digital Realty Trust.

During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments?

For this week's Weekly List, we examine Theme 7: Investing in the Cloud. Cloud computing has transformed the technology landscape over the past decade. Created almost accidently as a means or organizing customer invoices, cloud has grown from the management of outsourced technology hardware resources to encompass tasks, up to and including software development, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, following availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, awareness of generative AI hit the business community like an electric shock, and has completely upended IT spending plans for the next several years. Given that delivery of AI will mainly occur within a hybrid cloud environment, emergence of AI-as-a-service represents a difficult-to-quantify, but undoubtedly positive driver of cloud service revenues in the coming years. The leading providers of cloud services tend to be large technology and communications services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their cloud businesses. These companies include Amazon.com, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others in the U.S., along with Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others in China. Collectively, participants in the cloud eco-system grew revenue by a high-teens compound annual rate from 2016 to 2023. Revenue for cloud services has held up well, as cloud transition is a long-tailed process and cloud transformation has become an imperative. According to IDC, revenue in the industry grew 21% in 2024.

The selloff followed the failed assassination attempt on former President Trump, yet the two events seem oddly uncoupled. As the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pitched lower, most investors reiterated their belief that stocks had been overdue for a correction and that the selling was healthy rather than triggered by exogenous events. The election experienced an even bigger shift with President Biden's decision to exit the race rather than run for a second term. This decision was certainly not a shock and, as the president's poll numbers had deteriorated. So far, investors have greeted two significant events in the election with a muted response, as the focus remains mainly on the Fed's forthcoming meetings. The Market in July The S&P 500 had been up 18.8% for the year at its closing peak on 7/16/24. That was two full trading days (Monday and Tuesday) after the assassination attempt on the former president on Saturday 7/13/24 -- further contributing to the sense that the subsequent selling in stocks was unrelated to the events of that day. As of the market close on 7/19/24, the S&P 500 was up 15.4% year to date on a capital-appreciation basis and 16.4% on a total-return basis (with dividends). Before 7/13/24, the market already had undergone a shift in tone. Investors had started rotating away from the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, first remaining within other Information Technology sector niches and stocks and then gradually broadening out to other areas while taking tech profits. As of early in July, the Russell 2000 was little changed for the year. Between July 9 and July 16, the small-cap index exploded higher by about 11%. On the blue-chip front, the DJIA outperformed the broader S&P 500 during the mid-July selloff week, edging 0.2% higher while the S&P 500 was down 2.3%. And for the previous month, the Dow's 2.9% gain eclipsed the 0.7% advance for the S&P 500. Also on a total-return basis, the Nasdaq has maintained its advantage over blue chips, with an 18.6% total gain in the year to date. But the Nasdaq's margin over the broad market is uncommonly narrow in a year of double-digit gains and growth leadership. In 2023, for example, the Nasdaq's 43.4% capital gain beat the S&P 500's 24.2% gain by almost 20 points. And in 2020, the Nasdaq's 43.6% gain more than doubled the S&P 500's 16.3% advance.  Also as of 7/16/24, the DJIA was up 8.0% on a total-return basis. The Dow was up 1.1% year to date as recently as the final day of May, and much of its gain in 2024 has come in the month of July. Growth stocks continue to beat value stocks, but the difference between the Large Cap Wilshire Growth and Value indices has tightened from a gulf to a gap.  At the sector level, Information Technology (up 27.0% at 7/16/24) and Communication Services (up 23.5%) have maintained their leadership over the broad market. In an encouraging sign of improving breadth, five other sectors -- Financial, Utilities, Energy, Consumer Staples, and Industrials -- are up 10%-15%. And Healthcare is right behind, with a 9.4% gain. Even Real Estate, the lone negative sector through the first half of 2024, has pivoted to a 3% year-to-date gain. According to Argus' Chartered Market Technician Mark Arbeter, the major indices worked off extreme overbought conditions in the selloff week. But that came at the cost of breaking uptrends in 14-day relative strength and daily moving-average convergence-divergence. The S&P 500 during the selloff week broke below its 21-day exponential moving average for the first time since April 2024.  Despite the pullback, the market's uptrend off the lows from early May remains intact. The high-beta Nasdaq 100 remains a bit more fragile, having broken below its May lows. Many Nasdaq 100 component stocks are at or below 50-day trendlines. If many of these issues break decisively below support, rotation away from the year's leading sectors could persist for some time.   A President Exits the Campaign Following the announcement that a current president would not seek reelection, the S&P 500 surged by 2.1% and the index finished the year up over 15%. But we not talking about President Biden. On March 31, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson stunned the nation when he announced he would not seek, nor would he accept, his party's nomination to be president for a second full term. He had come to office upon the assassination of President John Kennedy in November 1963, and then defeated Republican Senator Barry Goldwater a year later in the November 1964 election.  Over half a century later, the reason President Johnson chose not to run remains a topic for debate. Officially, President Johnson indicated he could not conduct the war in Vietnam and actively campaign at the same time. Political pundits at the time pointed to Johnson's deep unpopularity as hundreds of U.S. soldiers were dying weekly in Vietnam. Many believed Johnson would lose to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon or to one of the anti-war candidates, such as Eugene McCarthy or Robert Kennedy, from within his own party. Following Robert Kennedy's assassination and a Chicago convention marked by riots and turmoil, Hubert Humphrey became the Democratic candidate despite not having won a single primary (he did win some state caucuses). Turning back to current events, should Vice President Kamala Harris become the nominee, as seems probable, she most likely will continue to promote the Democratic Party's principles. That should, for the most part, allow the growing number of undecided citizens the opportunity to cast their vote in a fair fight that is based on more-typical agenda considerations. Shifting Perceptions of the Fed Timeline As we prepared this publication, the Democratic Party was seeking to unite behind a new candidate; President Trump continued to campaign; and investors mainly have sidelined the political turbulence. The focus for investors, as it has been all year, remains the timeline for the Fed's widely anticipated first interest-rate cut in four years. For the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, the CME FedWatch Tool indicates a less than 3% probability that the first rate cut will come in July. After no meeting in August, the FOMC meets again on September 24-25. The FedWatch Tool indicates a 94% probability of a single quarter-point rate cut at the September meeting. For most of 2024, investors had been anticipating no change in Fed monetary policy at the November FOMC meeting. But the November 7-8 meeting falls two days after the November 5 elections date; and that earlier thinking may be changing. As of 7/16/24, target rate probabilities for the November FOMC meeting are 1.7% for no change from the current 5.25%-5.50% tendency; 43.1% for 5.00-5.25%; and 53.8% for 4.75%-5.00%. For the final FOMC meeting of 2024, to be held on December 18-19, target rate probabilities are 6.8% for 5.00%-5.25%; 45.1% for 4.75%-5.00%; and 46.7% for 4.50%-4.75%. That means the market now sees a nearly 50% chance that the Fed as of year-end 2024 will have cut the Fed funds rate not two but three times, for a total 75-basis-point rate reduction. Conclusion Elsewhere, the economy continues to grow at a low-single-digit rate consistent with our 1.7% GDP growth forecast for 2024. The consumer remains under pressure from high interest rates and the overhang of high prices. The housing sector is operating at 60% of past peak levels. Unemployment remains low by historical standards, and wages continue to grow faster than inflation. The second-quarter earnings season is unfolding about as expected, with prospects for high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage growth on an annual basis.   All of that is about status quo compared to the data and forecasts of recent months. Some things have changed, of course. At mid-year 2024, the presidential election featured Donald Trump versus Joe Biden. One of those candidates came within a fraction of being assassinated; the other is no longer in the race.

Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing.  If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to navigate the challenges. At Argus, a 90-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors.

During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments?

The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses."}, {"id": "42775_Market Outlook_1740571166000", "headHtml": "Daily Spotlight: Dollar Strength Reflects U.S. Economic Trends", "provider": "Argus Research", "reportDate": "2025-02-26T11:59:26Z", "reportTitle": "The dollar has strengthened into 2025, as the U.S. economy has grown at a somewhat surprisingly solid pace and the high level of interest rates has attracted global investors into dollar-denominated securities.

For one, the dollar typically tracks GDP growth trends, and we think the U.S. economic expansion is poised to slow in coming quarters as the unemployment rate ticks higher. In addition, we expect the higher rates to increase the interest payments as a percent of GDP from recent lows of 1.5%, putting a modest strain on the U.S. balance sheet; the current rate is 3.8%.

For global investors, a higher dollar is a positive factor for export companies (particularly from China), as their goods become relatively cheaper in the global marketplace.

During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments?

The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.", "tickers": ["MSFT", "GOOGL", "META", "NVDA", "AAPL", "TSLA", "AMZN"], "title": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments?

During his campaign, the president promised new tariffs. Some of these are now being rolled out, while others appear subject to negotiation.  Because the tariffs are mainly in a pending phase, economists have focused on other risks and opportunities from new policies. Immigration has been a major source of labor force growth in recent years, but fewer immigrants might keep unemployment low. The shake-out in federal employment has been devastating to those caught in the cross-hairs, but even big cuts in the federal workforce would return it to levels seen just a few years ago. Tariffs risk rekindling inflation, many economists agree, while noting that inflation is not a certainty. If companies are willing to absorb most of the higher costs, consumers may feel only moderate pain. If companies pass along most of the higher costs, consumers will see higher prices almost immediately.  Proponents note that the first round of tariffs enacted beginning in 2017 did not cause immediate inflation. Economists and scholars will long argue whether that first round had anything to do with the supply-chain crisis that ultimately contributed to inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic sits smack in the middle of this timeline and will forever complicate any clear analysis of the chain of events that ultimately led to the worst inflation in 40 years. The focus on the risks of tariffs triggering new inflation may be missing a larger point. U.S. consumers are still in the grip of existing inflation, and many consumers particularly in the lower tiers of the economy, appear tapped out. If tariff-sensitive companies decide to pass along the bulk of these costs rather than absorb them, instead of (or alongside of) rising inflation, we may see a slowdown in consumer spending. And with the consumer driving approximately 70% of U.S. GDP, that could send total GDP growth below the 2% level of 4Q24.  The Pre-2017 U.S. Consumer Argus President John Eade has identified the passage of Brexit, even more than the election of nation-first world leaders, as marking a key turning point in global relations and world trade. Prior to Brexit, much of the world was operating in a period of globalization that stretched back to the millennial turn or even before that. In this period, relatively free trade enabled developed countries such as the U.S. to effectively 'import deflation.' U.S. consumers benefited from relatively inexpensive goods, with prices that often were lower than those for the goods they displaced. The other price paid was steep, as high-quality jobs were lost to overseas relocation.  The consumer price index captures this benign pricing environment. In 2000, the Consumer Price Index was 172.2 (the baseline was established at 100 in 1982). By 2024, the CPI was 313.7. Using a simple compound average annual growth rate (CAGR) calculation, the CPI appreciated at an average 2.5% annual rate over the 2000-2024 period.  In the decade preceding the first tariffs in 2017, the consumer really had it easy. From 215.3 in 2008 to 245.1 in 2017, the CPI grew at a 1.5% CAGR. The Great Recession is at the beginning of this period and, like COVID-19, introduces a knotty complication into the calculation. The main point is that inflation in this period averaged a full half-percentage point below the Fed's 2% long-term target range.  As noted, the period following 2017 included the supply-chain crisis and a global pandemic, culminating in withering inflation. From 245.1 in 2018 to 313.8 in 2024, the U.S. consumer price index grew at a 3.6% CAGR. That includes some relatively benign years such as 2020 (1.2% CPI growth) and some really nasty periods such as 2022 (8.0% CPI growth). The point is that goods and services prices are up substantially from the last time America embarked on a significant round of tariffs. The 2025 Consumer Every U.S. consumer has felt the pressure of inflation over the past five or six years. Those on the bottom are feeling it more, however. The bifurcation between the upper half of consumers and the lower half has never been more pronounced. And the culprit once again is inflation. Any Economics 101 textbook likely explains inflation by examining what it does to goods prices. The inflation that kicked into high gear in 2022 has been characterized by particularly severe and sticky services inflation. Rents have gone up severely (and continue to rise), representing a larger and larger chunk of renters' take-home pay. Prices for all kinds of insurance, including vehicle insurance, have appreciated more and faster than overall inflation. Price for food and other necessities are also up sharply. Lower-tier consumers are severely strained by this burden and have less and less available for discretionary spending, from restaurant meals to laptops.  If you go to Walmart for a first-hand glimpse of this reality, you might be surprised at all the nice new cars in the parking lot. Walmart has been gaining higher income shoppers in recent years, and the trend appears to be accelerating. In May 2024, Walmart CEO John Rainey noted that the chain was seeing growth across income cohorts, 'with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains.' Walmart defines upper-income as households with more than $100,000 in income.  That trend was also evident when the company reported 2024 holiday-quarter sales in mid-February 2025. Walmart management also warned that it expected fiscal-year profit growth to slow, as the company would not be 'immune' from tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Upper-income consumers flocking to Walmart is a sign that no consumer is immune to the damage done by inflation. Enactment of new 10%-25% or even higher tariffs on major trading partners risks causing a slowing in consumer spending across the board.  Conclusion While there is no certainty on the timing and magnitude of tariffs here and worldwide, we expect impacted companies to respond with agility and flexibility as a means of maintaining business activity levels and retaining customer relationships. The practical implication is that companies will 'eat' some portion of tariffs, to the detriment of margins.  Multiple factors could mitigate the worst impacts, however. The first round of tariffs, the pandemic, and the supply-chain crisis all awakened Americans to the need to lessen reliance on outsourcing and to bring production of goods closer to home. The CHIPS & Science Act has encouraged the on-shoring of U.S. technology production, and the Inflation Reduction Act has used government resources to encourage domestic production of green energy solutions.  We continue to monitor risks and opportunities in the economy related to meaningful policy changes. Our base case remains that the economy will continue to grow in the low-2% range, unemployment will remain relatively close to current levels, and S&P 500 earnings growth will accelerate in 2025 from 2024 levels. Putting that all together, we believe the S&P 500 can appreciate in the 'normal' 8%-12% range in 2025, with leadership potentially shifting away from traditional growth sectors and toward cyclical, income-sensitive, and defensive sectors.", "tickers": ["TECH", "NVDA", "AMT", "VRSK"], "title": "Tariffs Could Hit Differently this Time The second Trump presidency has moved faster than the first to enact significant policy changes that are reshaping the federal government, immigration policy, and a myriad of other areas.

The point is that goods and services prices are up substantially from the last time America embarked on a significant round of tariffs. The 2025 Consumer Every U.S. consumer has felt the pressure of inflation over the past five or six years. Those on the bottom are feeling it more, however. The bifurcation between the upper half of consumers and the lower half has never been more pronounced. And the culprit once again is inflation. Any Economics 101 textbook likely explains inflation by examining what it does to goods prices. The inflation that kicked into high gear in 2022 has been characterized by particularly severe and sticky services inflation. Rents have gone up severely (and continue to rise), representing a larger and larger chunk of renters' take-home pay. Prices for all kinds of insurance, including vehicle insurance, have appreciated more and faster than overall inflation. Price for food and other necessities are also up sharply. Lower-tier consumers are severely strained by this burden and have less and less available for discretionary spending, from restaurant meals to laptops.  If you go to Walmart for a first-hand glimpse of this reality, you might be surprised at all the nice new cars in the parking lot. Walmart has been gaining higher income shoppers in recent years, and the trend appears to be accelerating. In May 2024, Walmart CEO John Rainey noted that the chain was seeing growth across income cohorts, 'with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains.' Walmart defines upper-income as households with more than $100,000 in income.  That trend was also evident when the company reported 2024 holiday-quarter sales in mid-February 2025. Walmart management also warned that it expected fiscal-year profit growth to slow, as the company would not be 'immune' from tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Upper-income consumers flocking to Walmart is a sign that no consumer is immune to the damage done by inflation. Enactment of new 10%-25% or even higher tariffs on major trading partners risks causing a slowing in consumer spending across the board.  Conclusion While there is no certainty on the timing and magnitude of tariffs here and worldwide, we expect impacted companies to respond with agility and flexibility as a means of maintaining business activity levels and retaining customer relationships. The practical implication is that companies will 'eat' some portion of tariffs, to the detriment of margins.  Multiple factors could mitigate the worst impacts, however. The first round of tariffs, the pandemic, and the supply-chain crisis all awakened Americans to the need to lessen reliance on outsourcing and to bring production of goods closer to home. The CHIPS & Science Act has encouraged the on-shoring of U.S. technology production, and the Inflation Reduction Act has used government resources to encourage domestic production of green energy solutions.  We continue to monitor risks and opportunities in the economy related to meaningful policy changes. Our base case remains that the economy will continue to grow in the low-2% range, unemployment will remain relatively close to current levels, and S&P 500 earnings growth will accelerate in 2025 from 2024 levels. Putting that all together, we believe the S&P 500 can appreciate in the 'normal' 8%-12% range in 2025, with leadership potentially shifting away from traditional growth sectors and toward cyclical, income-sensitive, and defensive sectors."}, {"id": "42685_Market Outlook_1739882097000", "headHtml": "Daily Spotlight: Understanding AI Growth Opportunities", "provider": "Argus Research", "reportDate": "2025-02-18T12:34:57Z", "reportTitle": "We expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 12% this year and like companies that increase their dividends at a 10%-plus rate.

The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date.   The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration.  October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings.  Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices.  For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%).  There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations.  PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point.  The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase.  Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months.  The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18.  According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather.  In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Reserve board, which reports this data, pointed out that industrial production in October was suppressed by a strike at a major aircraft producer (Boeing) and by the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. The Industrial Production index was 0.3 percentage point below its year-earlier level. Capacity Utilization of 77.1% for October was 2.6 percentage points below its long-run average. Factory orders for September were also impacted by the Boeing strike, declining 0.5%. Whereas actual activity in the industrial sector has been tepid, the election appears to have unleashed business optimism. The Empire State Manufacturing index was the first sentiment index to at least partially capture post-election sentiment. The index shot higher to 33.2 for November, from negative 11.9 for October; the consensus forecast for this series was 0.0%.

The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date.   The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration.  October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings.  Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices.  For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%).  There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations.  PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point.  The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase.  Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months.  The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18.  According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather.  In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Reserve board, which reports this data, pointed out that industrial production in October was suppressed by a strike at a major aircraft producer (Boeing) and by the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. The Industrial Production index was 0.3 percentage point below its year-earlier level. Capacity Utilization of 77.1% for October was 2.6 percentage points below its long-run average. Factory orders for September were also impacted by the Boeing strike, declining 0.5%. Whereas actual activity in the industrial sector has been tepid, the election appears to have unleashed business optimism. The Empire State Manufacturing index was the first sentiment index to at least partially capture post-election sentiment. The index shot higher to 33.2 for November, from negative 11.9 for October; the consensus forecast for this series was 0.0%. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reports its small business optimism index in the second week of December. This index, most recently at a depressed 93.7, is also expected to shoot higher on positive sentiment toward the change in administration.

Particularly in the second half of the month, investors head off to the mountains or the beach; trading desks are lightly staffed; and phone calls tend to dwindle. Little surprise that August on balance is an inconclusive month: since 1980, the S&P 500 has averaged a flat performance for the eighth month. There are outliers in both directions, of course, with big gains in 1982, 2002, and 2020; and big losses in 1990, 1998, and 2011. A Frantic August 2024 With one trading week remaining as we prepared this article, the S&P 500 was up about 2% for August 2024. While that number or something like it will be put in the ledger sheet, this August was uncommonly tumultuous. On the final trading day of July, the S&P 500 closed at 5,522. A deeply below-consensus July nonfarm payrolls number sent stocks tumbling, and by 8/5/24, the index was 6% below that level at 5,196. The suddenly popular perception was that the Fed, after badly missing the onset of inflation two-plus years earlier, had held rates too high for too long and was now allowing the economy to slip into recession. The panicky selling in the market belied other evidence that the economy was okay, if not exactly roaring. Second-quarter 2024 GDP grew 2.8%, double the growth rate reported for the first quarter. In addition, second-quarter S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations increased year-over-year in low double-digits, for the strongest growth in nine quarters. Simultaneously, there are rifts in the consumer and business economies, because goods and services have been too expensive for too long.  As of the beginning of August's final trading week, the S&P 500 had climbed back to within a percentage point of its all-time high. Fed Chair Jay Powell used the forum of this year's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium to allay recession fears. In his calm and reassuring speech, the Fed Chair stated that the 'time has come' to cut interest rates in response to cooler inflation and slowing economic growth. Inflation has 'declined significantly,' he added, and the labor market 'is no longer overheated.'  Perhaps most notably, Fed Chair Powell acknowledged, 'the balance of risks to our two mandates has changed.' Inflation is receding, and the mandate to return inflation to 2% has nearly been met. At the same time, the economy has softened from recent peaks, and the mandate to maintain maximum sustainable employment is now at risk.  Reversals in Fed policy, and particularly the move from raising rates to cutting rates, inevitably come at a fraught time for the economy. In those periods, the economy is seen as vulnerable to too little stimulus, while inflation is at risk of returning from too much stimulus. The Fed Chair's calm tone in addressing the dual mandate, in our view, was a necessary lubricant in the shift from restrictive to accommodative monetary policy. The market response - an 8.4% rally in the S&P 500 off the 8/5/24 lows, to 5,635 at the 8/23/24 close - suggests that investors broadly feel that the Fed in this cycle has successfully navigated the transition from fighting inflation to sustaining employment and economic growth.  New Favored Sectors Emerge The August gain in the S&P 500 will go in the books as a single number: the markets recovered, good job, and on we go. Beneath the surface, the market in August - and in an equally tumultuous July - has been undergoing a meaningful transition at the sector level. Investors' nearly two-year fascination with AI stocks has not gone away, but it has moderated somewhat. And AI stock winnings may now be a vital source of funds for investing in other areas perceived as timely in the currently unfolding interest-rate environment. During the third quarter to date, the two best-performing sectors have been Utilities and Real Estate. With one trading week left in August, the iShares Real Estate ETF IYR is up 14% for 3Q24; and iShares Dow Jones US Utility ETF is up 10%. Both sectors are perceived as sensitive to interest rates, and both have historically moved into favor when market rates of interest are declining. When Treasury and fixed-income yields begin to decline, some portion of bond investors rotate into stocks in pursuit of income provided by high-yield equity sectors. The rotation into Utilities and Real Estate stocks sends prices higher, causing yields to come down (assuming no change in dividend policy) as stock prices come up. Yields on Utilities and REIT, whether rising or falling, thus maintain a floating but relatively consistent differential with bond yields. We looked at Utilities sector performance across an approximately 20-year span dating back to the turn of the millennium. In an 11-sector index, we differentiate between a top-five finish (top-five performing sectors in any year) and a bottom-five finish (worst performing five sectors in any year). Utilities had top-five sector performances in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018, when interest rates were declining. Utilities had bottom-five performances in 2020, 2021, and 2023, when interest rates were rising.  Digging into the details from some of those years, Utilities were the third-best sector in the S&P 500 in both 2007 and 2008. The 10-year Treasury yield went from 4.8% on January 1, 2007, to 2.4% by December 31, 2008. Arguably, investors had other things on their minds in 2008, such as the Great Recession. Nevertheless, rotation into defensive sectors in troubled times is also a persistent theme. In 2011, which was not a particularly volatile time in the economy, Utilities were the best sector in the S&P 500. In that year, the 10-year year Treasury yield went from 3.4% on January 1, 2011, to 2.0% on December 31. Utilities were the second-best sector in 2014, as the 10-year year Treasury yield went from 2.8% on January 1, 2014, to 2.1% on December 31. Finally, Utilities were the second-best sector in 2018. Over a two-year span, the 10-year Treasury yield went from 2.5% on January 1, 2018, to 1.7% on December 31, 2019.  We do not have the same clear signal from Real Estate, given that the stocks were not broken out from the S&P Financial Sector until 2016. Additionally, whereas Utilities are monopolistic and regulated, Real Estate stocks operate in multiple industries spanning retail shopping, commercial real estate, doctors' offices, rental apartments, and more. Still, the performance of the two leading sectors in 3Q24 signals that the financial markets have fully embraced the reality and immanence of Fed rate cuts. Other sectors that are top-5 in 3Q24 include Financials Healthcare, and Industrial; all are up in the 7%-8% range for the quarter to date. Financial stocks such as banks would seem vulnerable to compression in net interest margins as rates come down. But the bigger outcomes from lower rates are the expected revival in commercial & consumer loans, including mortgages, and strengthening in fee-based businesses such as credit financing, IPOs, and M&A.  Healthcare stocks are expected to benefit as lower interest rates take some of the strain off consumer finances, enabling more discretionary and high-return medical procedures (i.e., new hips and knees). Industrial stocks are dependent on business-to-business (B2B) transactions and thus benefit from lower financing rates on major deals.  The bottom-five sector stocks in 3Q24 include two of this year's big winners: Information Technology and Communication Services. Both are up in the 1%-2% range for 3Q24, despite being up 22% and 20%, respectively, for all of 2024 to date. Two of the other laggards, Energy and Materials, are close to flat in the year-to-date, as the malaise from China (which is partly demographic in nature) overhangs all parts of the commodities complex. Consumer Discretionary was among the bottom two sectors (along with Real Estate) in the first half. Given prospects for lower rates helping the housing and automotive segments, Consumer Discretionary is doing a bit better - but is still in fourth place among 11 sectors in 2024. Conclusion After being down by 2% at mid-year, Real Estate stocks have made all their progress in the two months to date of the third quarter. Utilities are the more clearly perceived winner from rate cuts, and they have been rising for most of 2024. On a full-year basis, and using the iShares Dow Jones sector REITs, Utilities are the second-best sector for 2024; they lag only Information Technology and are currently a few ticks ahead of Communication Services.  Four sectors are beating the market in 2024: Information Technology, Utilities, Communication Services, and Financial. While that may not sound like much in an 11-sector market, it is better than in 2023, when three sectors (Information Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary) bested the S&P 500 total return of 25%. Moreover, in 2023 the three winning sectors were so dominant - up 66%, 44%, and 35%, respectively - that the other eight sectors averaged 3.4% capital appreciation for the year. In 2024, three other sectors - Healthcare, Industrial, and Staples - are all within a few percentage points of the index's 18% year-to-date gain. For the long term, portfolios and markets are healthiest when they are diversified. For a while in the current bull cycle, AI appeared to have a full-nelson lock on the market. While we do not expect the AI trade to unwind anytime soon, improved sector breadth across multiple equity sectors is a positive for preserving market momentum into year-end as well as for the years to come.", "tickers": ["GOLD", "NVDA", "RY", "NEM"], "title": "Rate-Cut Rotation August has a reputation as a sleepy time in global stock markets, and the U.S. is no exception. Particularly in the second half of the month, investors head off to the mountains or the beach; trading desks are lightly staffed; and phone calls tend to dwindle. Little surprise that August on balance is an inconclusive month: since 1980, the S&P 500 has averaged a flat performance for the eighth month. There are outliers in both directions, of course, with big gains in 1982, 2002, and 2020; and big losses in 1990, 1998, and 2011. A Frantic August 2024 With one trading week remaining as we prepared this article, the S&P 500 was up about 2% for August 2024. While that number or something like it will be put in the ledger sheet, this August was uncommonly tumultuous. On the final trading day of July, the S&P 500 closed at 5,522. A deeply below-consensus July nonfarm payrolls number sent stocks tumbling, and by 8/5/24, the index was 6% below that level at 5,196. The suddenly popular perception was that the Fed, after badly missing the onset of inflation two-plus years earlier, had held rates too high for too long and was now allowing the economy to slip into recession. The panicky selling in the market belied other evidence that the economy was okay, if not exactly roaring. Second-quarter 2024 GDP grew 2.8%, double the growth rate reported for the first quarter. In addition, second-quarter S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations increased year-over-year in low double-digits, for the strongest growth in nine quarters.

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing.

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified.

It includes the slightly rising 200-day average and the declining 21-day exponential, both of which were recaptured on Monday; a 38% and 50% retracement of the decline; and the closing and intraday breakdown levels from January 12 and 13. Above that, the falling 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) is at 5,854 and a 61.8% retracement as well as the declining 50-day average are up near 5,900.   Preliminary volume was light on the SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) and the QQQ, so Monday was not one of the accumulation days we are hoping to get. The SPX is close to a five-day/13-day EMA bullish crossover, which would reverse the bearish cross on February 21 when the index was still over 6,000.

JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets.

At Argus Research, we track ESG progress at specific companies as part of our Management analysis -- one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point System for fundamental research. In addition to reviewing and measuring the ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we have compiled focused lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have a \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records of delivering on the bottom line, and also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We also have a theme model portfolio based in part on ESG criteria. To build the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio, we apply financial concepts such as industry diversification, income generation, risk reduction, and growth at a reasonable price to our various lists. In addition, all stocks must be on the Argus BUY list. For more on JUST Capital's criteria, please visit the JUST Capital website, www.justcapital.com. For more information on the Argus companies, please see our Analyst Reports at www.argusresearch.com. Here are some of the stocks that are currently in the Argus U.S. ESG Theme Model Portfolio."}, {"id": "3110_Analyst Report_1689353137000", "headHtml": "Analyst Report: JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "provider": "Argus Research", "reportDate": "2023-07-14T16:45:37Z", "reportTitle": "JPMorgan Chase is one of world's largest diversified banking firms.

Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing.

Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba).
